## My Process
When creating this portfolio, I followed a structured and iterative process:

1. **Planning & Research**: 
   - Outlined the portfolio's goals and audience.
   - Researched design inspirations and best practices for portfolios.
   - Created wireframes to visualize the structure.

2. **Design**: 
   - Developed high-fidelity designs in Figma.
   - Focused on a clean and user-friendly layout, ensuring visual hierarchy and consistency.

3. **Development**:
   - Converted designs into responsive HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Implemented interactive elements using JavaScript and libraries.
   - Ensured compliance with accessibility standards, including alt text, semantic tags, and ARIA attributes.

4. **Testing & Iteration**:
   - Conducted cross-browser and device testing.
   - Gathered feedback and iterated on the design.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Responsive Design
- **Issue**: Adapting the layout for various screen sizes was challenging, especially when aligning multiple elements.
- **Solution**: Utilized media queries and CSS Flexbox/Grid for responsive design. I tested thoroughly using developer tools and real devices to ensure usability.

### Challenge 2: Accessibility
- **Issue**: Making the site fully accessible required a detailed understanding of ARIA roles and semantic HTML.
- **Solution**: Studied W3C accessibility guidelines and incorporated ARIA labels, skip links, and alt text for all images.

### Challenge 3: Performance Optimization
- **Issue**: Initial load times were slow due to large images and external dependencies.
- **Solution**: Compressed images using online tools and implemented lazy loading for non-critical content.
